# Enable root access to x-windows system.

# Motivation: Trying to run a graphical application as root via su, sudo in a 
# Wayland session (e.g. GParted or Gedit), will fail. Apps which use polkit to
# request administrator permissions for just certain operations and only when 
# needed are not affected (they are not started as root right away).
